#summary Compilation warnings and errors to fix.

= Introduction =

Just post whatever warnings the compiler may say which you think are effecting functions.


= Details =

*possibly harmful warnings (line references as of code in revision 129):*

*gc_memory/memory.c:84:* warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules

*gc_memory/memory.c:3522:* warning: integer constant is too large for "long" type
*gc_memory/memory.c:3530:* warning: integer constant is too large for "long" type

*gc_memory/pif.c: In function `internal_ReadController':*
*gc_memory/pif.c:359:* warning: the address of `controllerCommand', will always 
evaluate as `true'

*gc_memory/pif.c:366:* warning: the address of `controllerCommand', will always 
evaluate as `true'

*gc_memory/pif.c: In function `internal_ControllerCommand':*
*gc_memory/pif.c:433:* warning: the address of `controllerCommand', will always 
evaluate as `true'

*gc_memory/pif.c:465:* warning: the address of `controllerCommand', will always 
evaluate as `true'

*r4300/ppc/MIPS-to-PPC.c: In function `convert_R':*
*r4300/ppc/MIPS-to-PPC.c:937:* warning: comparison is always true due to limited 
range of data type

*r4300/ppc/MIPS-to-PPC.c:939:* warning: comparison is always true due to limited 
range of data type

*r4300/ppc/MIPS-to-PPC.c:957:* warning: comparison is always true due to limited 
range of data type

*r4300/ppc/MIPS-to-PPC.c:959:* warning: comparison is always true due to limited 
range of data type

*r4300/ppc/Recompile.c: At top level:*
r4300/ppc/Recompile.c:38: warning: 'genRecompileBlock' declared `static' but 
never defined

*r4300/ppc/ppc_disasm.c: In function `trapi':*
*r4300/ppc/ppc_disasm.c:208:* warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used
as truth value

*r4300/ppc/ppc_disasm.c: In function `cmpi':*
r4300/ppc/ppc_disasm.c:227: warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used
as truth value

*r4300/ppc/ppc_disasm.c: In function `bc':*
*r4300/ppc/ppc_disasm.c:308:* warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used
as truth value

*r4300/ppc/ppc_disasm.c: In function `cmp':*
*r4300/ppc/ppc_disasm.c:421:* warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used
as truth value

*r4300/ppc/ppc_disasm.c: In function `trap':*
*r4300/ppc/ppc_disasm.c:435:* warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used
as truth value  




*Note: I fixed up most of the things apart from those up there and a few more casting problems (mainly ARAM, and especially ROM_Cache functions)
Things I didn't touch: main_gc.c and anything in the GUI/GX/SoftGFX folders. 
This is due to those constantly being changed at the moment.*

*gc_audio/audio.c:*
static char which_buffer = 0; changed to static int which_buffer = 0;

int f; changed to
int f = 32000; //default to 32khz incase we get a bad systemtype

*rsp_hle-ppc/jpeg.c:*
added brackets around the XOR operations. such as line 467,468 etc.

*rsp_hle-ppc/ucode3.c:*
lines 204,209,234,405,617,627 fixed parenthesis

*rsp_hle-ppc/ucode2.c:*
lines 179,184,197,393,500,607,1235 fixed parenthesis

*rsp_hle-ppc/ucode1.c:*
lines 189,194,207,217,402,510,599 fixed parenthesis

*Rom_Cache.h:*
casted things in the ARQ functions (arg 5 and 6) to (unsigned int)
