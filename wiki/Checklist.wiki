#summary Features and Optimizations to be implemented
#labels Phase-Design

=== Introduction ===

Most of these shouldn't be major goals, but things we would like to see in the emulator, or optimizations we think would get things running better.  Try to explain features, and try to describe the optimizations if possible.


= Checklist =

  * *Dev Feature:* Debug prints that collect text and display it on the FB for a few frames/seconds (Good enough for now)

  * *Dev Feature:* Profiling different plugins or code paths

  * *Optimization:* Redesign the TLB LUTs to use a small hash map (Completed)

  * *Optimization:* Initialize the correct video mode for each ROM region (to achieve proper FPS)
  
  * *Optimization:* Change some RSP code to utilize the DSP

  * *Feature:* GUI (3D menu would be very cool and appropriate) (Completed)
    * *Sub-Feature:* Being able to 'pause' emulation to go to menu and return (Completed)
  
  * *Feature:* Rewrite the file browsers to be modular (ie one browser for multiple places to load from)
  and to possibly use the new menu system. (Completed)

  * *Feature:* Rumble pak (Completed)
    * *Sub-Feature:* Hot-swap between mempak and rumble pak (Completed)

  * *Feature:* Allow for a save option to be "Do not save" (Completed, just don't save!)

  * *Feature:* Saving to Gamecube memory cards (Completed)

  * *Feature:* Save states
  
  * *Feature:* MP3 support in the RSP (May actually work, needs confirmation)
  
  * *Feature:* Widescreen and 480p support (NTSC 480p support now)
